# Xabean's DIY H-Shifter

Design goals:

* A shifter that supports dynamic reconfiguration through swapple H-pattern plates [todo]
* Use of linear Hall-Effect sensors, so there are no mechanical switches to wear out. [complete, in theory]
* Firmware support for calibrating the Hall-Effect sensors [done]


## Features

* Configurable additional-switch support, so you can have splitters for ATS/ETS or whatever else you want.

## Dependencies

You will need a copy of the [ArduinoJoystickLibrary](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary)
